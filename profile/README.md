Commuting to work sustainably is hard. Currently there is no app or service within Australia that allows commuters to discover and plan sustainable commutes and with the impending deadline of net zero by-2050, we must all play a part in ensuring that we make the most sustainable decisions.

We beleive that this app and help cut carbon emissions in Australia as well as helping Australian citizens with getting around with the easiest, cost efficent and eco-freindly way.

## About the App

It is a purpose-built application allowing citizens to plan their travel with sustainability in mind. Citizens can enter their destination and they are presented with a list of sustainable travel options ranging from renting a bike to catching public transport, each with a corresponding star rating on how carbon efficient the route is. These ratings are calculated in real time based on all available data sources. *(Please read data story for more info)*

### In-app Features 

The app also features tag on/off functionality when using public transport, meaning that users donâ€™t need to bring their transport pass. QR codes can also be placed on transport options allowing users to scan them and learn more about the environmental impact of the transport option.

Users can then view their carbon summary report every few weeks allowing them to quantify how much carbon they have saved.
